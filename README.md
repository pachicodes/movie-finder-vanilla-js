### What did you learn in this project?
I learned to prioritize. I was initially planning to do this with React, but due to personal circumnstances I had less time than I would like, so I changed my plan and decided to go on a Route that I was more comfortable with and sure I could delivery my best work by the deadline, while with React, since it is new to me, I couldn't guarante the quality of the final product.
